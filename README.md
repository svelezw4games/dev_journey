# W4 dev journey repo!

Welcome to your developer journey! In this repository, we provide open-source code for you to share your experience at GodotCon – whether it's through creating code, sharing event photos, or asking questions. At W4, we aim to be a solution for you, and together, we can build great things. Feel free to introduce yourself or upload your version of the project. (And don’t forget to be respectful to others while collaborating!)


# Rules

- This code will be available until October 26th, when Expo EVA Argentina concludes, so dive into the experience while you can!


- Feel free to add more features from the event, like polls, your experience from the talks, or simply a greeting from your character or the project you're working on. Introduce yourself – we'd love to get to know you! And if you find a bug, don’t hesitate to let us know.
